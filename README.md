# Weather Precipitation Prediction using Machine Learning

This project analyzes a dataset containing over 2,600 weather observations to predict precipitation occurrence based on various weather conditions. The data is processed and cleaned to handle missing values and duplicates. Although the exact timestamps are unknown, the data is assumed to be in chronological order.

## Project Overview

- **Data Cleaning:** Identifying and handling missing or duplicated data points.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing the dataset to uncover patterns and relationships.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementing classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Decision Trees using the Scikit-learn library.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance to select the best approach for precipitation prediction.

## Technologies and Tools

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Usage

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file). To run the analysis:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 and the required libraries installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt` or manually install the libraries).
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
4. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to follow the data processing, analysis, and modeling steps.
